# slothspeed-twitter-bot
Being tired of not getting the internetspeed my ISP promised me to get, I wrote this little program
to annoy them and mention them on Twitter with the speedtest.net results I got. 

It uses the speedtest.net CLI and Twitter API to send them the results of an average of 2 speedtests.
